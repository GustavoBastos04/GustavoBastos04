At Vivo, I'm currently working as a Networks Intern, in an architecture team for B2B clients. I'm responsible to check switches status on the architecture and ensure that all the data related to the links and ports are synchronized on the network and in our databases. I'm also participating in projects that involves automating the area, building Python scripts that check devices conditions and gather data from them.
