At NICE, I'm currently working as a Portfolio Solution Engineer Intern, focused on the Presales process. I'm responsible for supporting the sales team of a cloud-based platform that generates customer experience by unifying channels, routing, automation, and analytics. This support involves programming customer journey scripts across channels, integrating with databases, CRMs, third-party systems, channels like WhatsApp, and through REST APIs. I also configure the platform environment and AI-enabled self-service chatbots. Furthermore, I answer technical requirements in commercial proposals such as RFPs.
